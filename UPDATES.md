## Environment Setup (May 21, 2025)

### System Requirements
- Linux-based operating system (tested on Ubuntu)
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- g++ compiler with C++11 support
- Make build system
- OpenSSL development libraries

### Project History Preservation (May 21, 2025)
1. **University Project Archive**: Preserved the original project developed during university studies on February 17, 2020, after learning C/C++
2. **Educational Context**: Maintained original code as a reference point showing programming skill progression over 5+ years
3. **Historical Context**: Kept original README and source files to document project evolution
4. **Legacy Database Schema**: Preserved original database design from 2020 for reference
5. **Documentation Updates**: Added explanations about the university project context in the main README
6. **Code Evolution**: Provided clear distinction between original academic implementation and new professional architecture

### Installation Process
1. Successfully installed MySQL server and verified service is running
2. Installed required development libraries:
   - libmysqlclient-dev for MySQL C API
   - libssl-dev for OpenSSL integration
3. Created and configured the database with appropriate permissions
4. Compiled and tested the application with various scenarios

## Specific Issues Resolved

### 1. MySQL C API Integration
- **Issue**: Missing header includes led to compile-time errors for MySQL functions
- **Solution**: Added all necessary headers and verified MySQL development libraries were installed
- **Benefit**: Application now correctly links to MySQL C API and uses it for database operations

### 2. Database Schema Improvements
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraints were missing proper indexes
- **Solution**: Added necessary indexes to support foreign key relationships
- **Benefit**: Improved database integrity and query performance

### 3. Variable Scope in Switch Statements
- **Issue**: Variable declarations inside switch cases caused jump errors
- **Solution**: Moved variable declarations outside the switch blocks
- **Benefit**: Eliminated compilation errors while maintaining code functionality

### 4. Constructor Member Initialization
- **Issue**: Warning about member initialization order not matching declaration order
- **Solution**: Rearranged initialization list to match class declaration
- **Benefit**: Eliminated warnings and ensured predictable initialization behavior

### 5. Application Configuration
- **Issue**: Hard-coded database credentials made deployment difficult
- **Solution**: Moved all configuration to DBConfig.h with clear documentation
- **Benefit**: Easier configuration management and deployment in different environments
